It would be really helpful to include a link to a markdown cheat sheet.  [This is a good example](http://support.mashery.com/docs/read/customizing_your_portal/Markdown_Cheat_Sheet) of where to get a good rundown of basic markdown.

> We can place block quotes this way
> It's quite lovely

```
We can also block out code segments.

x <- rnorm(100)
hist(x)
```

If we want to make a table

| Column 1 | Column 2 | 
|----------|---------:|
| r1, c1   | r1, c2 |
| r2, c1   | r2, c2 |
&nbsp;

The &nbsp; makes a non breaking space that is useful for putting in white space.

We write _italic_ text this way.

And we can make **bold** text this way

Lists are simple

* Item 
* Item 
* Item

Ordered lists are easy too

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
